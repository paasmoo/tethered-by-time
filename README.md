## ✍️ **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **Designing the game:** I loved to create the sprites, even though I'm not really good at drawing. It was a surprise to me that the pixel art looks really good!
- **Refactoring the code:** I refactored the code at the end of the code lab so that every feature was in it's own file and some redundancies were removed.

### Challenges:
- **Bug Fixes:** The scrolling mechanic was very bugged at the beginning and it took me 3 days to fully fix it but now everything is working fine!
- **Readjusting the variables:** I had to fine-tune the variables for the modifiers and then also finetune the levels based on the modifiers so that the player can beat the level with any modifiers applied.

### Lessons Learned:
- **Creating the gameplay first:** I tried to create some pixel art for the game before even working on the code and I had many problems implementing this pixel art into the game so I had to redo some of it after I've written the overall code for the game.
